#' Set an alternate directory for mock API fixtures
#'
#' By default, `with_mock_api` will look for mocks relative to the current
#' working directory (or the test directory). If you want to look in other places,
#' you can call `.mockPaths` to add directories to the search path.
#'
#' It works like [base::.libPaths()]: any directories you specify will be added
#' to the list and searched first. The default directory will be searched last.
#' Only unique values are kept: if you provide a path that is already found in
#' `.mockPaths`, the result effectively moves that path to the first position.
#'
#' For finer-grained control, or to completely override the default behavior
#' of searching in the current working directory, you can set the option
#' "dbtest.mock.paths" directly.
#'
#' This function is an extension of [httptest::.mockPaths()] from
#' [httptest](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=httptest)
#'
#' @param new Either a character vector of path(s) to add, or `NULL` to reset
#' to the default.
#' @return If `new` is omitted, the function returns the current search paths, a
#' a character vector. If `new` is provided, the updated value will be returned
#' invisibly.
#' @examples
#' identical(.mockPaths(), c("tests/testthat/", "."))
#' .mockPaths("/var/somewhere/else")
